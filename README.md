## The Problem

The modern job market is broken. It's plagued by:

- **üëª Ghost Jobs:** Postings left open for months to pool talent with no real intent to hire.
- **ü§´ Salary Secrecy:** Lack of upfront salary and benefits information wastes everyone's time.
- **üîá Recruiter Ghosting:** Candidates invest hours into applications and interviews, only to be met with silence.
- **ü§ñ Application Black Holes:** Sending applications feels like shouting into the void.

## Our Solution: The Core Features

LinderJobs is designed from the ground up to solve these problems with a set of non-negotiable features:

- **‚è≥ Dynamic 20-Day Job Posts:** Job posts automatically expire after 20 days. This ensures all listings are active and urgent.
- **üèÖ Recruiter Accountability Badge:** Recruiters who fail to engage with applicants on a closed job post receive a temporary "Unresponsive" badge on their profile. Good behavior is a visible asset.
- **üí∞ Mandatory Salary & Benefits:** Every single job post **must** include a clear salary range and a list of benefits. No exceptions.
- **üí¨ Unlimited Direct Contact:** We encourage genuine connection. All users can send direct messages to recruiters and participate in networking events.
- **ü§ñ AI Application Assistant:** An integrated AI helps candidates craft a concise, high-impact summary of their qualifications, helping them stand out and saving recruiters time.
- **‚≠ê AI Behavioral Rating (Experimental):** A lightweight AI analyzes public interactions to provide a general "professionalism" rating, promoting respectful communication on the platform.
